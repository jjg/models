# models

I'll be moving all of the 3D models I design to this repository.  I expect them to be in OpenSCAD format, but there may be some exceptions for the rare model I've designed in something else.

For models that belong to a specific project that has its own repository, those models may not wind-up here (unless they have utility outside of the project they were designed for).

I might include STL files if it doesn't make the repository too large, but we'll have to wait and see.
