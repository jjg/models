    Gullickson Laboratories Model One
    (desktop music system)
    
    Heavily inspired (perhaps even a tribute?) to the Henry Kloss/Tivoli
    Model One table radio.
    
    The main unit consists of:
    * A speaker
    * A preamplifier
    * A power amplifier
    * A volume control
    * An input selector switch
    * A line input labled "aux"
    * A phono input
    *
